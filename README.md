### Time-series-prediction
### This repository contains different approaches for Time series prediction on stock data.
* Moving Average and random walk used as baseline prediction to compare other ML algorithms with them
* Exponantial Smoothing including: Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), Double Exponential Smoothing (Holt's) and Tripple Exponential Smoothing (Holt's-winter)
* ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA
* Deep learning approaches: Univariate and Multivariate deep learning algorithms implemented.
