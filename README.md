### Time-series-prediction
### This repository contains different approaches for Time series prediction on stock data.
* Moving Average and random walk used as baseline prediction to compare other ML algorithms with them
* Exponantial Smoothing including: Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), Double Exponential Smoothing (Holt's) and Tripple Exponential Smoothing (Holt's-winter) implemented.
* ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA implemented with analyzing them.
* Deep learning approaches: Univariate and Multivariate deep learning algorithms implemented.
* Univariate DL includes: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and LSTM Models (Vanilla LSTM, Stacked LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, CNN LSTM, and ConvLSTM 
* Multivariate deep learning consists: Multiple Input series with Stacked LSTM and  Multiple Parallel Series.
